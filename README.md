# pyqd
A package for simulating arbitrary quantum dot systems with or without leads. Systems can be simulated purely classically as charge islands or quantum mechanically using various models, including models for superconducting charge islands.

This branch is an overhaul of the original package, with the goal of restructuring the code to be more clear, fixing known bugs, and introducing additional solver models.

## TODOs:

- Implement classical eigenvalue sorter for arbitrary systems of classical charge islands.
- Implement fermionic solver for arbitrary sets of fermionic quantum dots.
- Implement semiclassical solver for semiconducting and superconducting quantum dots in a charge basis.
